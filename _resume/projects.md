## IPython
### [Project Euler Solutions][euler-nbviewer]
These are solutions written for math/algorithmic problems found on <https://projecteuler.net/>.  The solutions are
organized in a functional and executable IPython package.  My goal is to solve all the problems when I have free time,
but the problems seem to be getting a lot harder!  Project solutions are made available on [Github][euler-github].-->
