## About Me

### Welcome to my dimension
>   Incoming transmission: ...

Greetings!

My name is Ahmed Tadde, and I am a young *data-hungry* analyst with a deep interest in data
analytics and visualizations.

I enjoy building tools and visualizations *from scratch*, and have a curious mind to constantly dig deeper to uncover
simpler *abstractions* of seemingly complex problems.  I highly *dislike inefficiency* and repetitive wastes in designs
and processes, and I strongly believe it is worth the effort to master efficient techniques to better my personal life
and make equivalent impacts on other people.

My ordered preference of hacking tools include: `Python > R > Javascript > SQL`.

### Tell me more...
>   We require more minerals!

Curiosity and an obsessive inner drive to finding simpler abstractions of complex problems has embarked me on a journey
of "programming" [autodidactism][].  Despite graduating from Howard University with a degrees in Economics and Mathematics,
I have stumbled onto the new planets of **Programming**, **DataAnalytics**, and **DataVisualizations**.

The voyage was initially rough and foreign, but 2-3 years of drifting and exploring in this grand Dataverse has made
me fall in love with all the material, frameworks, and best practices that I "stumbled" through self-learning.

I strongly believe that a combination of interest, personal-drive, *practice* and ease-of-access to coding
resources in today's era (*thank you [Google][] and [Stackoverflow][]*) are the key catalysts for learning fast.

<!-- Just as I have received these gifts from the community, I feel much obliged to *contribute back*, and I hope this
website could inspire a few datanauts to venture into the unknown and come back as passionate pioneers.  -->

<!-- Spare time is hard to come by these days.  There are too many interesting Dataverses to explore and map out.  
Whenever possible, I try to make time for playing PC games (Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, some DotA), as well as
practicing ink-drawings.

I live with my wonderful fiance, whom is also a data master of sorts in her quest in researching [osteosarcoma][]
cancer.  We share our residence with our two awesome cats, `Metal` and `Sneakers`. -->
