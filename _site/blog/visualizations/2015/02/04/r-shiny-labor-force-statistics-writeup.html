<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>In this visualization application, we want to draw conclusions and trends about labor statistics in the US, by 
comparing employment and unemployment rates across races, genders, occupations, and education levels.</p>

<p>The original datasets are derived from the Current Population Survey (<a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/">CPS</a>) released by the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics.  The native HTML table presentation of the data makes it difficult to <em>visualize and derive trends</em>.</p>

<p>Take a look at this:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/cps-02.png" alt="image-cps-02"></p>

<p>as opposed to this:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/trend-unemployed-rate.png" alt="image-trend-unemployed-rate"></p>

<p>We will delve into details on some interesting topics revolved around:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Labor Force Trends (<a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat02.htm">cps-02</a>)</li>
<li>  Employment by Occupation (<a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat14.htm">cps-14</a>)</li>
<li>  Employment by Education (<a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat07.htm">cps-07</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The writeup will go into detailed analysis on some of the more interesting findings in the visualization sections.<br>
An in-depth overview on data gathering, cleaning, and transformation of the original datasets will be outlined in 
the <a href="#data">Data</a> section.</p>

<p>At any time, feel free to experiment and draw your own conclusions with the interactive web application and refer to
the <code>.R</code> files found on the <a href="https://github.com/chrisrzhou/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics">Github</a> project site if you need details on code implementation.</p>

<h2 id="labor-force-trends">Labor Force Trends</h2>

<h3 id="what-does-the-us-population-look-like">What does the US population look like?</h3>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/trend-population.png" alt="image-trend-population"></p>

<p>It appears that the US population is still <em>growing</em>.  In addition, note that the population of women is <em>higher</em> than
men.</p>

<h3 id="so-who-is-not-working-in-the-labor-force">So who is NOT working in the labor force?</h3>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/trend-non-labor-force.png" alt="image-trend-non-labor-force"></p>

<p>We see that a proportionately larger number of women are still not in the labor force, despite a slightly larger 
women population.</p>

<p>The next bar chart provides another view on the labor force by gender, by looking at employment <em>rates</em> instead of 
raw population headcount as displayed in the previous graph. </p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/trend-employed-rate.png" alt="image-trend-employed-rate"></p>

<p>We observe that there has been an increase in women being employed in the labor force over time (from 47.7% in 1980 
to 53.2% in 2013).  This is a good sign and hopefully things continue to trend towards gender equality.</p>

<h3 id="should-gender-equality-apply-to-all-industries">Should gender equality apply to all industries?</h3>

<p>Let&#39;s take a quick look at the <em>agriculture</em> industry sector, where we intuitively identify manual labor being 
employed more readily in men than women.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/trend-agricultural-labor-force.png" alt="image-trend-agricultural-labor-force"></p>

<p>Whoa! This makes intuitive sense, but there are some other interesting questions that can be gathered from this 
visualization:</p>

<ol>
<li>  <em>Why is there a slight jump in women agriculture labor force from 1994-1999?</em></li>
<li>  <em>Why is there a sudden decrease in agriculture labor force recent years after 2000?</em></li>
</ol>

<p>These are questions that require research outside of the dataset, but I thought a few resources that I read online 
are potentially interesting explanations for some of the questions raised out of curiosity:</p>

<ol>
<li> I have not found a possible answer for this, but I&#39;ll leave it for the audience to dig into why there is a slight 
jump in women agriculture labor force involvement from 1994-1999.</li>
<li> This maybe due to the fact that farm decline stabilized around 1997, as detailed in this
<a href="http://www.usda.gov/factbook/chapter3.htm">USDA article</a>, as total land for farms remained the same after a decline in overall farms
(i.e. farms stabilized into larger farms, which probably consolidated equipment and labor requirements over time)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="how-about-the-unemployed">How about the unemployed?</h3>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/trend-unemployed-rate.png" alt="image-trend-unemployed-rate"></p>

<p>From this bar chart, we see that both men and women suffer through economic recessions.</p>

<p>For some interesting facts, here are some details on major <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States">recessions</a> that occurred in the US.  I&#39;m not an expert 
in labor statistics, but it seems that unemployment rates straggle a few more years after the recession periods 
before recovery.  And we seem to be experiencing some kind of recession every 10 years, although this is more of 
an observation and not a conclusive statement with the small dataset we are working with</p>

<ul>
<li>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_1980s_recession">Early 1980s Recession</a> (1981 - 1982)</li>
<li>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_1990s_recession">Early 1990s Recession</a> (1990 - 1991)</li>
<li>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession">The Great Recession</a> (2007 - 2009)</li>
</ul>

<p>This wraps up some of the visualizations that I found interesting.  Feel free to play with the webapp to discover 
more findings!  In the next section, we will study in more detail how each race and gender group perform in various 
occupations and industries at certain age groups.</p>

<p><sub>(back to <a href="#contents">contents</a>)</sub></p>

<h2 id="employment-by-occupation">Employment by Occupation</h2>

<h3 id="a-quick-overview">A quick overview</h3>

<p>The next facet plot visualization helps us get a quick overview on relative percentages of employed people across 
genders and races in various occupations and industries, sliced by age groups.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/occupation-all.png" alt="image-occupation-all"></p>

<p>Some quick observations and comments:</p>

<ul>
<li>  We will use percentages to convey the data instead of raw head counts, which will skew the visualization towards
the <strong>White</strong> demographic.</li>
<li>  All percentages within a race (column) sums up to 100% in a given age group, this helps us determine the 
relative gender and racial distribution for each age group across occupations and industries.</li>
<li>  We observe that for age group 1 (16-19 years), most younger people in the labor force are engaged in 
<strong>Wholesale/Retail</strong> as well as <strong>Leisure Services</strong> occupations, and for age group 4 (55 years and older), most
older people are engaging in <strong>Education/Health Services</strong>.  This seems to make intuitive sense: younger people 
engage in industries that require higher energy and attention while older people fit better in less energetic 
industries.</li>
<li>  Men-dominated industries include <strong>Transportation/Utilities</strong>, <strong>Mining/Extraction</strong>, <strong>Manufacturing</strong>, and 
<strong>Construction</strong>, while women-dominated industries include <strong>Education/Health Services</strong>.  The rest of the 
industry seem to have relatively equal gender distributions across all races.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="men-dominated-industries">Men-Dominated Industries</h3>

<p>Knowing that men are better suited at labor-intensive roles, we can take a closer look at the primary industry 
sector comprised of <strong>Transportation/Utilities</strong>, <strong>Mining/Extraction</strong>, <strong>Manufacturing</strong>, and <strong>Construction</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/occupation-male-dominated.png" alt="image-occupation-male-dominated"></p>

<p>A few interesting things stand out:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Most of the primary industry sector labor force is in the age group 2 and 3 (20-24 years and 25-54 years).</li>
<li>  We see a general trend of lower <strong>Mining/Extraction</strong> and <strong>Construction</strong> jobs in favor of 
<strong>Transportation/Utilities</strong> and <strong>Manufacturing</strong> jobs for the higher age groups, which makes intuitive sense 
as manual labor-intensive jobs are better suited for the younger population.</li>
<li>  There is another observation that Hispanic males are disproportionately involved in the <strong>Construction</strong> 
industry sector (as circled in red above, e.g. 19.9% Hispanics vs 13.6% White for age group 3)</li>
</ul>

<p>By highlighting a specific age group (e.g. 20-24 years), and focusing on the blue columns which represent men labor 
force, we can see some variations among the races in the occupations they engage in.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/occupation-male-dominated-age-group-2.png" alt="image-occupation-male-dominated-age-group-2"></p>

<p>For age group 2 (20-24 years):</p>

<ul>
<li>  Asians are engaged more in <strong>Manufacturing</strong>.</li>
<li>  Blacks are engaged more in <strong>Transportation/Utilities</strong>.</li>
<li>  Hispanics are engaged more in <strong>Construction</strong></li>
<li>  Whites are engaged slightly more evenly in <strong>Manufacturing</strong> and <strong>Construction</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the next sections, we will take a close look at some specific industries across the dimensions of race, gender 
and age groups.</p>

<h3 id="education-and-health-sector">Education and Health Sector</h3>

<p>First up, we have the <strong>Education/Health</strong> sector, where we can obviously identify it as a women-dominated sector.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/occupation-education-health.png" alt="image-occupation-education-health"></p>

<p>Here is a summary of the distribution across age groups in <strong>Education/Health</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Asians have roughly equivalent distribution across age groups.</li>
<li>  All the other races seem to have growing distribution towards working in the <strong>Education/Health</strong> sector as the 
labor force gets older.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="public-administration-sector">Public Administration Sector</h3>

<p>There is a clear increase of older labor force participating in the <strong>Public Administration</strong> industry sector, with 
roughly equal gender distributions.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/occupation-public-administration.png" alt="image-occupation-public-administration"></p>

<h3 id="business-and-finance-sector">Business and Finance Sector</h3>

<p>A quick look at the visualization suggests that younger people (age groups 1 and 2) are more engaged in 
<strong>Wholesale/Retail</strong>, while the older people (age groups 3 and 4) are engaged in <strong>Professional/Business Services</strong> 
and <strong>Finance Services</strong>.</p>

<p>Gender distributions across these service sector look roughly equivalent.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/occupation-sales-business-finance.png" alt="image-occupation-sales-business-finance"></p>

<p>This wraps up some detailed facet plot visualizations of multi-dimensional analysis of labor force statistics across
industry, occupations, gender, races and age groups.</p>

<h2 id="employment-by-education">Employment by Education</h2>

<p>We all hear the saying that getting a Bachelor&#39;s degree is <em>necessary</em> to finding jobs.  We will take a deeper look 
into the dataset provided by CPS.</p>

<h3 id="by-gender">By gender</h3>

<p>Here are some quick numbers of the labor force by education level attainment.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/education-labor-force-by-gender.png" alt="image-education-labor-force-by-gender"></p>

<p>Most people in the US seem to have attained Bachelor degrees, or attended college with some associate or no degree.</p>

<p>When we zone in on the unemployment rates, we find an inverse correlation with educational level and unemployment 
rate.  People holding bachelor degrees or attended college earning an associate degree have much lower unemployment 
rates than individuals who have not attended college or earned any degree.</p>

<p>Judging by the numbers, it is recommended that you should try to earn at least an associate degree in college, since
the unemployment rates of graduating high school and attending college earning no degree are roughly the same.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/education-unemployment-by-gender.png" alt="image-education-unemployment-by-gender"></p>

<p>The next section filters the results by race instead of gender.</p>

<h3 id="by-race">By race</h3>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/education-labor-force-by-race.png" alt="image-education-labor-force-by-race"></p>

<p>The unemployment rate trend is essentially the same as we observed in the gender overview i.e. a higher education 
degree confers better chances of getting a job.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/education-unemployment-by-race.png" alt="image-education-unemployment-by-race"></p>

<p>However something stands out.</p>

<p>We see that the Black and Hispanic populations have higher unemployment rates than the other races at each education
level attainment.  This may or may not be due to racial discrimination, but if we made the assumption that education
has delivered equal opportunities to individuals developing skills for work, then this is an area of improvement we 
can work on if racial discrimination exists.</p>

<p><sub>(back to <a href="#contents">contents</a>)</sub></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite the focus on expressing gender and racial equality statistics on labor force, I strongly believe that
  the topic of labor statistics should revolve around <strong>ability equality</strong> and not around gender and racial equality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As seen in the example of agricultural jobs, women lack the natural ability to perform in this industry, and this 
should not be interpreted as discrimination when we evaluate people&#39;s ability to do certain work.</p>

<p>We need to be careful about over-emphasizing the obsession in optimizing &quot;gender/racial-equal&quot; numbers, which in my 
opinion, is another form of discrimination by overly stressing the concepts of genders and races, when our ultimate 
goal is to hopefully not create concepts of races and genders when we are engaging in professional evaluations of 
people.</p>

<p>Our solutions in education and government policies should be geared towards empowering individuals with <em>equal 
opportunities</em> to pursue what they want to achieve in their careers, and it is very important that pre-employment 
education is provided for every individual fairly, so that the true test of employment can be judged on a merit 
basis, instead on trying to optimize &quot;gender/racial-equal&quot; metrics.</p>

<p>In the future, it is my hope that all <code>gender</code> and <code>race</code> data in these visualizations contained can be collapsed, 
providing us with a simple analysis on our labor force statistics (as shown in the bar chart below without grouping 
by gender and race), one that is evaluated from all human individuals, as opposed to one evaluated based on races 
and genders.</p>

<h2 id="data">Data</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>This section provides details on the data source and processes that go towards scraping and munging the initial 
  unorganized data into a consolidated R dataframe that is used in the Shiny app.  We will make references to the 
  files on the <a href="https://github.com/chrisrzhou/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics">Github</a> project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All data is owned by the Current Population Survey (<a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/">CPS</a>) made available by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  I am 
not affiliated with CPS, and this writeup and application is purely for practicing and sharing thoughts behind data 
management and visualization.</p>

<p>If you are not interested in the data background and processes, feel free to jump back to the visualization sections!</p>

<h3 id="data-source">Data Source</h3>

<p>We will be using the following CPS datasets:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat02.htm">cps-02</a>: Time series of employment statistics by gender.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/cps-02.png" alt="image-cps-02"></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat14.htm">cps-14</a>: Most recent employment statistics by industry, age, gender, and race.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/cps-14.png" alt="image-cps-14"></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat07.htm">cps-07</a>: Most recent employment statistics by education level, gender, and race.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/cps-07.png" alt="image-cps-07"></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Careful observation of the native data presentation suggests that the data tables involve some nesting.  For a 
general workflow with R and Shiny visualizations, we would need to collapse the data into a <em>flat</em> dataframe structure.</p>

<p><em>Luckily</em>, it looks like the HTML tables themselves <em>follow some kind of pattern</em>.  The fact that some consistent 
structure exists means that we can put our data munging skills to good use and transform the data into a better 
structure for reusable code in future programs.</p>

<p>But first, let&#39;s scrape the data before cleaning it up!</p>

<h3 id="data-scraping">Data Scraping</h3>

<p>For the following section, we will walk through only one example of a data scraping/munging step abstracted in the 
function <code>get_labor_trend</code> in the <code>/data/parser.R</code> file.  We will refer the readers to dig into the other functions 
in detail at their own pace (most of them are similar in construction and abstraction).</p>

<p>Open the <code>/data/parser.R</code> file and locate the <code>get_labor_trend</code> function.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In general, it is a good idea to build your data processing steps into multiple readable functions, so that they
  can be called in future applications and programs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We will use the package <code>XML</code> for reading a HTML table into an R dataframe with the help of the function 
<code>readHTMLTable</code>.</p>

<p>We first define the <code>url</code> and <code>colnames</code> variables, where the <code>url</code> points to the CPS dataset URL, and <code>colnames</code> is 
a convenient <em>named</em> vector to pass both the column names and column types to the dataframe we are creating with 
<code>readHTMLTable</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The use of a <em>named</em> vector for <code>colnames</code> allows us to easily extract two sets of information in one variable
  i.e. <code>names(colnames)</code> extracts the names while <code>unname(colnames)</code> extracts the format types of the named vector
  <code>colnames</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We pass in <code>stringsAsFactors=FALSE</code> to prevent conversion of string variables into factors, which will be quite a 
pain to deal with for future processes, so let&#39;s just keep to primitive data types used in common programming 
languages.</p>

<p>By using the R-console and a couple of <code>print</code> statements, we learn that the variable <code>tables</code> is a list of HTML 
tables that are found on the URL.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are interested, you can view the source page of the URL and check that there are indeed the same number 
  of tables as the dimensions of our <code>tables</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assuming that CPS keeps the format of their dataset/webpage in the same format, we can locate the data we want as 
the second table in the URL.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s assign this to the variable <code>df</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-R" data-lang="R"><span class="n">df</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">tables</span><span class="p">[[</span><span class="m">2</span><span class="p">]]</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Try printing the value of<code>df</code>.</p>

<p>It looks a little unstructured, despite living in a dataframe.  Our goal now is to reshape the dataframe into a flat
and long format, and this is best accomplished using the great <code>dplyr</code> library produced by Hadley Wickham, which 
beautifully abstracts common reshaping workflows in R into a concise and readable syntax and implementation</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The rest of the data section assumes elementary knowledge of <code>dplyr</code>.  We assume familiarity with methods such 
  as: <code>%&gt;%</code>, <code>mutate</code>, <code>select</code>, <code>arrange</code>, <code>rename</code>.  Please check out the official <code>dplyr</code> <a href="http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html">official guide</a>

<h3 id="data-munging">Data Munging</h3>

<p>With <code>dplyr</code> and <code>reshape2</code>, it&#39;s time to hack and slash!</p>

<p>Let&#39;s do some very basic cleaning steps to rename the columns and remove <code>NA</code> records (caused by nesting in the 
original HTML table that produces whitespaces during the data import through <code>readHTMLTable</code>).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-R" data-lang="R"><span class="n">colnames</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">df</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">names</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">colnames</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="c1"># rename columns
</span><span class="n">df</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">df</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">%&gt;%</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">na.omit</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="c1"># remove NAs
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The next step is to spend some time carefully observe the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat02.htm">cps-02</a> dataset and its structure and patterns:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/cps-02.png" alt="image-cps-02"></p>

<p>And see if we can wrangle it to, perhaps, this preferred nice, flat and long structure:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/long-wide-df.png" alt="image-long-wide-df"></p>

<p>Notice that the original data structure has column headers which can be pivoted into values under a new variable 
<code>population</code>.  This will allow us to pivot and reshape the wide dataframe into a long dataframe if we pivot on the 
variables <code>year</code> and <code>gender</code>.</p>

<p>However, there is one pesky problem.</p>

<p>The gender in the original data structure is located in a <code>subtotal</code> row.  We need to find a way to populate the 
<code>&quot;Men&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;Women&quot;</code> gender values in all the data records, while potentially acknowledging that the dataset 
records can vary (inclusion or exclusion of years for each gender).</p>

<p>Our human skills of observation and pattern recognition intuitively suggests to us that this dataset contains twice 
the amount of record for each gender.  By observation, we also note note that the initial data is sorted by <code>&quot;Men&quot;</code>,
then by <code>&quot;Women&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>This suggests that we can generate a dynamic <code>genders</code> vector with number of records dependent on the size of the 
dataframe itself i.e. <code>genders=c(&quot;Men&quot;, &quot;Men&quot;, ..., &quot;Women&quot;, &quot;Women&quot;)</code>.  R does this nicely for us through the use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-R" data-lang="R"><span class="n">genders</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">rep</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">c</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Men"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Women"</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">each</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">nrow</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">df</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="c1"># create genders column to correct length
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Print the variable <code>genders</code> to see for yourself, we indeed have a vector <code>genders=c(&quot;Men&quot;, &quot;Men&quot;, ..., &quot;Women&quot;, 
&quot;Women&quot;)</code> that we can integrate into our dataframe <code>df</code> using <code>dplyr</code>&#39;s <code>mutate</code> method.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-R" data-lang="R"><span class="n">df</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">df</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">%&gt;%</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">mutate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">gender</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">genders</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="c1"># add gender column
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The last step for the data munging process is to pivot the dataframe from wide to long format on the variables 
<code>gender</code> and <code>year</code>.  This collapses all the column headers into data values under a new column variable, which we 
will call <code>population</code>.</p>

<p>Reassign the &quot;melted&quot; dataframe to itself again, and convert the <code>population</code> column into a <code>character</code> column 
(BOOOO to factors unless we absolutely need it!), and finally do some cosmetic sorting with the <code>arrange</code> method.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-R" data-lang="R"><span class="n">df</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">melt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">df</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nf">c</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"year"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"gender"</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">%&gt;%</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="c1"># melt from wide to long
</span><span class="w">        </span><span class="n">rename</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">population</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">variable</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">%&gt;%</span><span class="w">
        </span><span class="n">mutate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">population</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">as.character</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">population</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">%&gt;%</span><span class="w">
        </span><span class="n">arrange</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">gender</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">population</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Try printing <code>df</code> again:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/long-wide-df.png" alt="image-long-wide-df"></p>

<p>Woohoo! This looks clean and long, just what we need for data post-processing and visualizations!</p>

<p>Please feel free to go over the other functions and data manipulation steps.  The general idea is common across all 
of them, and they are summarized below.</p>

<h3 id="data-recap">Data Recap</h3>

<ul>
<li>  Abstract data gathering and processes into functions.</li>
<li>  Define variables, and utilize the strengths of named vectors through the R functions <code>names</code> and <code>unname</code>.</li>
<li>  Load the HTML tables into dataframes initially with     <code>readHTMLTable</code>.</li>
<li>  Build vectors using <code>rep(vector, each)</code> by careful observation of the original data structure and desired final 
data structure.</li>
<li>  Include all missing columns into the dataframe before the final pivot step to collapse the dataframe from wide 
to long, with the help of <code>reshape2</code>&#39;s <code>melt</code> function.</li>
</ul>
